o Person names do not wrap on site highlights
o Strange Zoom/Resolution/Calibration problem
o No message informing the user when there is no video for a site
o Exiting the Admin window without saving will discard changes without prompting
o The map doesn't scale correctly at any resolution besides the HHBC kiosk's native resolution
o The pin locations are pixel based, so changing the resolution will change their location on the map.
o The site highlights should look like speech bubbles (or like Google Maps' bubbles) instead of just a rounded rectangle.
o If two sites are very close together, you have to wait for the site highlight to appear to select one of them.
o The text columns on the text page of the sites are a buggy hack. Replace the current implementation with the new Text Layout Framework.
